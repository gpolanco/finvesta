# üß† GLOBAL RULESET FOR ALL PROJECTS
# This file defines the universal conventions and constraints
# that all AI assistants (e.g., Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.) must follow
# across all development contexts unless explicitly overridden.

---

## üß± Technical Stack
- Use React 19 and Next.js 15 (App Router).
- Use TailwindCSS 4 for styling.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use `shadcn/ui` for UI components.
- Use `react-hook-form` and `zod` for form and validation logic.
- Avoid usage of legacy Next.js features like `pages/`, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`.
- For testing, use **Vitest** by default.

---

## üì¶ PACKAGE MANAGEMENT
- Use `pnpm`.
- To execute commands directly, use `pnpm dlx`.
- When installing Shadcn components, use:
  `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
- Never use `shadcn-ui` (deprecated or incorrect variant).
- If components already exist, DO NOT reinstall or overwrite.

---

## üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION
- Organize code by **domain** (e.g., `/contexts`, `/projects`, `/auth`).
- Domains should contain:
  - 
  - `components/`
  - `lib/`
  - `actions/`
  - `queries/`
- Avoid generic folders like `/pages`, `/utils`, `/atoms`, etc.
- Import using `@/` aliases instead of relative paths.
- All tests must live in a top-level `/tests/` folder, replicating the structure of `/src/`.
- Project documentation location varies (check `/docs/`, `/tasks/`, etc.).

---

## üé® UI/UX CONVENTIONS
- Use Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS.
- Use `shadcn/ui` for all UI needs.
- Always make components responsive (at minimum: mobile + desktop).
- Design mobile-first, then scale up.
- Use accessible semantic HTML and ARIA roles when needed.
- Use `lucide-react` for all icons.
- Use tooltips, loading states, and skeletons when appropriate.
- Layouts must use consistent grid and spacing, avoiding visual clutter.
- Use `<label htmlFor="...">` properly linked to inputs.
- Forms must include a cancel button to reset or close.
- Destructive actions (delete, reset, etc.) must trigger a confirmation modal or equivalent.
- Any action that affects state should provide immediate feedback (toast, spinner, etc.).
- Empty states must show icon + brief message + optional CTA.
- Animations should be subtle, performant, and last <300ms.
- Avoid scroll jumps or layout shifts when switching tabs or views.
- Avoid hardcoded widths/heights unless required. Prefer responsive units.

---

## üß† CODE STYLE & PRACTICES
- Use `async/await`, avoid `.then()` chaining.
- Follow TypeScript strict mode rules.
- Use descriptive naming: `getUserProjects`, `updateProjectTitle`, etc.
- Avoid abbreviations unless domain-specific.
- Document complex functions using JSDoc/TSDoc.
- Avoid comments that repeat the code (e.g. `i++ // increment i`).
- When writing complex logic, add an inline `// Reason:` comment explaining **why**, not just what.

---

## üîê AUTH & SERVER RULES
- Access Supabase via `server-only` in RSC contexts.
- Never expose secrets or sensitive logic to the client.
- Use Supabase auth helpers (`getUser`, `getSession`) on server components.

---

## ‚úÖ TESTING
- All new features must have at least 3 tests:
  - 1 expected use
  - 1 edge case
  - 1 failure case
- Tests must be placed in `/tests` directory, mirroring the `/src` structure.
- Use `vitest` by default.
- After updating any logic, verify if tests need to be updated.

---

## üßØ COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID
- Do NOT install already installed dependencies.
- Do NOT re-install or overwrite existing components.
- Do NOT delegate incomplete work to the user.
- Do NOT forget responsiveness in UI.
- Do NOT output code fragments: always return complete usable code.

---

## üìù COMMITS
- Follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, etc.
- Every commit message must end with: `Don't forget to commit!`
- Suggest a commit command: `git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <message>"`
- Check project-specific commit templates for additional requirements

---

## üìö DOCUMENTATION & EXPLAINABILITY
- Update `README.md` when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- Comment non-obvious code and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.

---

## üîÅ TASK BEHAVIOR
- Break large tasks into atomic steps if needed.
- If context is unclear, ask the user before assuming.
- Always finish what you start. Do not leave files half-written.
- If implementing multiple files, output one at a time with filenames.

---

## üß© EXTENSIBILITY PRINCIPLES
- Prefer composable, modular, and extendable code.
- Structure components, logic, and actions in a way that allows growth without rewrites.
- Avoid hardcoded logic or tightly coupled modules.
- Use design patterns (e.g. Strategy, Adapter, Facade) when it helps decouple complexity or external providers.
- Prefer pure functions and explicit dependencies.
- Avoid hidden side effects, context leaks, and global mutations.
- Prepare all logic layers for future refactor or scaling.

## ü§ñ AGENT BEHAVIOR
- Behave as a proactive, reliable senior developer assistant.
- Always prioritize delivering complete, clean and working code.
- Never leave placeholder code or TODOs unless explicitly asked.
- Never stop mid-task unless it's technically impossible to continue.
- Never delegate unfinished logic back to the user without good reason.
- Always ask for clarification if the task is ambiguous or under-specified.
- Avoid adding unnecessary abstractions or overengineering.
- If you're unsure between two valid implementations, briefly explain the options and suggest one.
- Write code as if it will be reviewed by a meticulous, no-BS team lead.
- Respect all rules in this file strictly, without reinterpretation.

## üßë‚Äçüíª AGENT ROLE & MINDSET

You are a **proactive and reliable AI assistant** acting as a **senior full-stack software developer** working on this project as part of a high-performance engineering team.

Your responsibilities include:

1. Helping to build and improve web applications following best practices.
2. Strictly following the defined tech stack:
   - Next.js 15 with React 19 (App Router)
   - TailwindCSS 4 and shadcn/ui
   - TypeScript as the main language
   - Supabase for backend/auth/DB
   - Domain-based folder structure
3. Maintaining awareness of project state:
   - MVP in active development
   - Always read project documentation before starting
   - Follow internal documented workflow
4. Starting work by providing clean, complete code
5. Following rigorous task tracking:
   - Check and update project task tracking
   - Mark completed tasks
   - Document any discovered subtasks
6. Ensuring high standards of quality:
   - Responsive and accessible components
   - Modular, extendable logic
   - Proper testing for new features
   - Avoiding errors like redundant dependency installation or incomplete logic

üéØ Your mission is to accelerate project development while maintaining quality, consistency, and alignment with established best practices. Always refer to project-specific rules for additional context and requirements.


## üìö Documentation Index (for reference)

Agents should refer to project-specific documentation:

- Check for `docs/` or `tasks/` directories for project documentation
- Look for `README.md` files in project root and subdirectories  
- Follow project-specific rules files in `.cursor/rules/`

## üìå FINAL RULE
> When in doubt, ask. When confident, execute.

## ‚úÖ Task Handling (global)

- Follow project-specific task tracking structure
- Before starting work:
  - Read `PLANNING.md` and `TASKS.md`
  - If the task is missing, add it under ‚ÄúPlanned Tasks‚Äù with today‚Äôs date
- While implementing a task:
  - Use checklist format for subtasks (`- [ ]`)
  - Log any newly discovered subtasks under ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù
- Upon completion:
  - Mark the task as `[x]`
  - Do not delete task history or alter task context
- Be clear, atomic, and descriptive in task names and progress
